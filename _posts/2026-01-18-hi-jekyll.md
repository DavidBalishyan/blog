Welcome to my new blog!

This plays a small part in my journey to document my learning process, share code snippets, and generally keep track of the cool things I'm building.

## Why this blog?

I've always believed that the best way to learn is to teach (or at least, to write it down). Whether it's a tricky bug I squashed, a new framework I'm exploring, or just some thoughts on software development, you'll find it here.

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with **Jekyll**, a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. I've customized the default Minima theme to use the **Gruvbox Dark** color palette because, let's be honest, it's the easiest on the eyes for late-night coding sessions.

### Syntax Highlighting

One of the main reasons for this setup is to share code. Here's a quick example of how code snippets look with the new theme:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end

print_hi('David')
#=> prints 'Hi, David' to STDOUT.
```

And here is some Python for good measure:

```python
import os

def list_files(directory):
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        print(f"Found file: {filename}")

list_files('.')
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

- My current projects
- Web development tips
- Linux configurations
- And whatever else interests me

Thanks for stopping by. Stay tuned for more!
