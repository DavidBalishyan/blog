I’ve spent way too much time tweaking my Linux setup. Most of my work is on Debian. I appreciate its stability, but I dislike how “stale” the default settings feel. Over the past year, I’ve changed it into a lean coding machine. It’s not just about looks; it’s about reducing the friction between my brain and the code.

Here’s a breakdown of the main parts of my setup and why I chose them.

### 1. Neovim: Beyond the IDE

I finally switched to Neovim, and I’m never going back. You can find my full config in the nvim/ directory of my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/DavidBalishyan/dotfiles).

I started with [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). If you’re worried about configuring a text editor from scratch, start there. It gives you a solid foundation with LSP, Telescope, and Treesitter without the extra baggage of “distributions” like AstroVim or LunarVim.

The biggest game-changer for me was Telescope. Being able to fuzzy-find through files, search for strings, and jump to definitions without leaving the home row is addictive. Using it makes VS Code feel slow.

### 2. The Terminal: Custom Zsh

I’m a Zsh user. I know Fish is easier and Nushell is more modern, but Zsh strikes the right balance because it’s POSIX-compatible and has an amazing range of plugins.

For a long time, I used [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh). It’s good for beginners, but I eventually noticed it was slowing down my shell startup time and i wanted to understand the way my shell configuration works. One day, I deleted the folder and started a **.zshrc** from scratch.

I manually added what I actually needed: zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting. For the prompt, I’m using [Starship](https://starship.rs). It’s fast and looks great out of the box, but I’m starting to want to write my own shell prompt just for fun.

### 3. Tiling Window Managers: BSPWM

I’ve tried a lot of tiling window managers. I started with i3, tried Sway and Awesome, and even explored Hyprland (which is beautiful but felt too heavy for my Debian workflow).

Right now, I’m settled on **BSPWM** (Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager).

Why **BSPWM**? It perfectly follows the Unix philosophy; it doesn’t even handle keybindings. You use a separate daemon called **sxhkd** for that. This separation makes the whole system feel modular and very stable. For the status line, I use Polybar. It’s highly configurable and doesn’t get in the way.

### 4. How I Manage the Chaos

If you’re not using version control for your configs, you’re taking a risk. I manage everything with a simple Git repo. Whenever I make a change that doesn’t break anything, I push it. This makes setting up a new machine a 5-minute task instead of a 5-hour headache.

Finding the balance between “ricing” for the sake of it and actual productivity is a constant struggle. But every time I `Super+enter` into a new terminal window that opens instantly, I know it was worth it.
