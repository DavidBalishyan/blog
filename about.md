Hello! I'm **David Balishyan**.

I am a passionate developer, creator, and lifelong learner based in Yerevan, Armenia. I love building software that solves real-world problems and exploring the depths of new technologies.

### My Journey

My journey into the world of tech started with my interest in programming. Since then, I've been on a constant path of learning and growth. I believe that code is more than just instructions for a computer; it's a medium for creativity and innovation. Whether it's debugging a complex issue or designing a sleek user interface, I find joy in the process of creation.

### What I'm Keeping Busy With

Currently, I'm focusing on:

- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects and building my own tools.
- **Blogging**: Documenting my findings and sharing knowledge right here.
